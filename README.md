## Overview

This repository, **Digital-Systems-and-Microcontrollers**, hosts all laboratory exercises, code examples, manuals, and reports associated with the Digital Systems and Microcontrollers course. It is organized into three primary sections—Arduino code implementations, lab manuals, and lab reports—to facilitate hands-on learning and systematic documentation of all experiments.

## Repository Structure

* **Arduino Codes**
  Contains all Arduino sketches and supporting code for in-class and take-home microcontroller experiments.

* **Lab Manuals**
  Detailed procedural guides for each laboratory session, including objectives, required components, and step-by-step instructions.

* **Lab Reports**
  My reports documenting experimental setups, observations, data analysis, and conclusions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Hardware**: Arduino Uno/Arduino Mega boards, sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR), actuators (motors, servos), breadboard and jumper wires.
* **Software**:

  * Arduino IDE (version ≥ 1.8.x)
  * C++ toolchain (this repo is entirely C++ based)


## Arduino Codes

Each folder under **Arduino Codes** corresponds to a specific lab experiment:

1. **Mux and Demux**
2. **ALU**
3. **Sensor Interfacing (Ultrasonic, IR, Temperature)**
4. **Shift Register**


**To upload a sketch**:

1. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the correct Board and COM port under **Tools**.
3. Click **Upload**.

## Lab Manuals

Inside the **Lab Manuals** directory, you will find PDF documents organized by session number:

* **Lab 1 Manual**: Introduction to Arduino and digital outputs
* **Lab 2 Manual**: De Morgan’s Theorems and Binary Full Adder
* **…**
* **Lab 7 Manual**: Binary cell for RAM
* **Lab 8 Manual**: Bus-based ALU-Register Data Transaction

Each manual includes:

* **Objective**
* **Background Theory**
* **Component List**
* **Circuit Diagrams**
* **Procedure**
* **Pre-Lab and Post-Lab Questions**

## Lab Reports

The **Lab Reports** directory contains my submissions in PDF format, each named using the convention:

```
<Roll_number>_Lab_Report<session_number>.pdf
```

Reports include:

* **Title Page**
* **Aim/Objective**
* **Electronic Components Used**
* **Reference Circuit**
* **Procedure**
* **Link of the TinkerCAD simulation**
* **Images and Videos (if any)**
* **Observation**
* **Conclusion**
